    abstract = { A computer simulation of a department of diagnostic radiology was performed to find out the most important factors that influence the transit time of the patients. Furthermore the general applicability of simulation models to this type of system was also analysed. The transit times were mainly dependent on staff number and the arrangement of radiographic devices. The model worked satisfactorily in normal conditions but improvements can be made as to the routines for exceptional situations like the treatment of emergency patients. }
